24-Bit RISC CPU Simulator
===========================

Author: Juan Cantu  
Course: EECE 6380 - Computer Architecture  
Project: 24-bit Custom RISC CPU  
Submission: Final Report and Python-based Simulator

-------------
How to Run:
-------------

1. Unzip the project folder.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
3. From the unzipped directory, run the following command in terminal or command prompt:

   python main.py

This will execute the 24-bit RISC processor simulator using the test program included in the code.

-------------
Notes:
-------------

- The simulator models a 5-stage MIPS-style pipeline.
- Instruction behavior, register file updates, and pipeline states are printed to the console.
- No additional dependencies are required beyond standard Python.

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!
